# Open3DSIM
This code was created by Ruijie Cao and Prof. Peng Xi in Peking University for 3D super-resolution structure illumination microscopy reconstruction. We are devoted to make the SIM community open and constructive. And we will continue to improve the platform.

1. The Open-3DSIM.rar is the initial version of Open-3DSIM, including the Fiji version and MATLAB code, in a standalone rar file.
2. The Open-3DSIM-v1.0.zip is the updated version of Open-3DSIM, adding the Exe application for the convenience of users.
3. The Open_3DSIM_Exe_v1.0.zip, Open_3DSIM_Fiji_v1.0.zip and Open_3DSIM_MATLAB_v1.0.zip are the three version in the Open-3DSIM-v1.0.zip, to facilitate users to download as needed.
4. The test_data.zip is the test dataset for the platform. For more samples, please download from Figshare: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Open_3DSIM_DATA/21731315.
5. Each version contains a detailed user guide.
6. We also provide a video to guide users to install the Fiji version (on the above Fishare link) in Install_Fiji_Screenshot.mp4. For any questions, please contact caoruijie@stu.pku.edu.cn or xipeng@pku.edu.cn.

Update on 2022.12.25. Here, we thanks Dr Christophe Leterrier in Aix-Marseille Universit√© for his data on N-SIM. We will make Open-3DSIM to be compatible to Nikon N-SIM system as soon as possible.

Update on 2022.12.30. Here, we proposed Open_3DSIM_MATLAB_v1.1.zip and Open_3DSIM_Exe_v1.1.zip to be compatible to Nikon N-SIM system. The test data has been uploaded on Figshare (on the above Fishare link).
