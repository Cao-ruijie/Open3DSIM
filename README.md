# Open3DSIM
This code was created by Ruijie Cao and Prof. Peng Xi in Peking University for 3D super-resolution structure illumination microscopy reconstruction. 
We are devoted to make the SIM community open and constructive. And we will continue to improve the platform.

1. We provide the pure source code of three platforms of Open-3DSIM, including MATLAB, Fiji, and Exe.
2. The whole code files of three platforms can be downloaded from tags in this resposity.
3. The test_data.zip in tags provide three input format examples of OMX, N-SIM, and home-built 3DSIM systems. 
4. For more samples, please download from Figshare: https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Open_3DSIM_DATA/21731315.
5. Each version contains a detailed user guide.
6. We also provide a video to guide users to install the Fiji version (on the above Fishare link) in Install_Fiji_Screenshot.mp4.
