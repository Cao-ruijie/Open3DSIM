External dependencies for the compilation of fairSIM:

rt-1.6.jar	: Runtime library jar for Java 1.6, to enable cross-compilation
ij147v.jar	: ImageJ base library, to be compiled as ImageJ plugin

On Linux systems with internet connection, running the
'get-dependencies.sh' script should download and extract these jars
automatically.


ImageJ version:

We currently still support Java6-based versions of ImageJ. This is a rather
arbitrary choice, based on when development was started, and might change
in the future. 

The lowest supported ImageJ version is 1.47v, released in July 2013.
